# Fast-Fingers

A small program that I wrote while learning Nim. It's purpose is to improve your typing speed and general knowledge.

```
Usage:
  ./main <length>
```

Regular typing experience:
* Takes a length from CLI and a text from the `texts` file, prints it to the screen with the choosen length.
* If you type something wrong, it will turn into red.
