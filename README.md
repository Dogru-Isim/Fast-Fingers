# Fast-Fingers

A small program that I wrote while learning Nim. It's purpose is to both improve your typing speed and general knowledge.

```
Usage:
  ./main <length>
```


* Takes a length from CLI and a text from the `texts` file, prints it to the screen with the choosen length.
* If you type something wrong, it will turn into red.
* If you press backspace, the red char will be replaced back to the originial one and you will continue from there (regular backspace behaviour)
